			<h1> A little about Asa Nisi Masa... </h1>
			<p>
				Having met at East 15 Acting School last year, Asa Nisi Masa have collaborated on 
				several projects, most notably the short film Webbed (starring Alan Grant), which won the 
				Jury Prize at the 60 second International Film Festival and was in the Official Selection 
				at the Tres Court International Film Festival. As well as creating and rehearsing their own work for the festival, the lads 
				are all living successful lives as actors. Most recently Jake Sharp has starred in BBC One's 
				Doctors while Gabriel Farnese is appearing in Guy Richie's The Man From UNCLE for Warner Bros, 
				due in cinemas in 2015.
				<br><br>
				Asa Nisi Masa bring two shows about masculinity to the fringe this year - 
				Going Out West and Pennyroyal (a one man show performed by Eamonn Hearns with Assembly Hall).
				<br><br>
				Asa Nisi Masa is interested in raising questions on the themes of Man and Masculinity - 
				what is expected of a man in today's society, and how is he perceived? We feel these are 
				important topics to be raised for both women and men - digging below the surface with humour 
				and an askew perspective.

				<u>Gabriel Farnese</u>
				<br><br>
				GABRIEL FARNESE was a finalist at the monologue competition at the 2013 
				International Film Festival in Rome. Gabriel is a British/Italian actor 
				who graduated from East 15 Acting School. He is also a co-founder of Asa Nisi Masa. 
				He was born in Bologna, Italy in 1988, and spent half his life in Italy, and half 
				in the UK. He started working as an assistant director on films and television series, 
				before turning to the acting world. Gabriel played the part of Milvio on the Italian 
				television series 'Tutta La Musica Del Cuore' which averaged more than 5.5 million viewers 
				per episode. Since graduating from East 15, Gabriel landed the part of Count Lippi in the

				EAMONN HEARNS is from Wicklow in Ireland and is a co-founder of Asa Nisi Masa. While earning 
				a BA in English & Philosophy from University College Dublin, he trained and qualified as a

				<u>Jake Sharp</u>
				<br><br>
				JAKE SHARP is from a small village just outside Wolverhampton in the Midlands. He has just graduated 
				with an MA in Acting from East 15 Acting School and is starting to make his way in the business. 
				He is very proud to be a co-founder of Asa Nisi Masa, and is delighted to be able to use this opportunity 
				to explore the identity of being a 'real' man - a topic that has fascinated him throughout his life. 
				Jake originally studied as a primary school teacher at the University of Wolverhampton. He decided 
				this was not for him, so then spent many years working as a builder's labourer, and then for the police. 
				Jake spends most of his time playing guitar and singing, and is unashamedly a fan of musical theatre. 
				He very much enjoys sports - his favourite being cricket (it is a sport). Jake recently played the part of 
				Ben Ogden in 'Doctors' on the BBC.
